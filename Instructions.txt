If you want to customise your experience, then simply edit the values in config.txt.

Recommended:
Image:          world_map_full.png [Put a pic in the res/Maps/ folder, must be green and blue]
Reproduction:   8  [This is the threshold of reproduction, lower = higher birthrate]
Empires:        10 [This is the number of empires the simulation begins with]
PLEASE NOTE, setting the empire count too high can cause CRASHES, hence it will check your number, and change it if you set it too high!
