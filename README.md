# Civilization_Autonama
- A simulation of world empires running real time based on cellular automaton.
- Empires will fight each other for dominance.
- The empires population can explode, and it can die of disease.
- The "world map" can vary: from certain regions (e.g., Europe, North America), other planets (e.g., Mars), and fictional places (e.g., Westeros).
- Heavily inspired from Hopson97.
